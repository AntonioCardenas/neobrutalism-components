## Installation

These React components use <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwind</a> for styling and <a target="_blank" href="https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/">react-icons</a> for icons (feel free to use any other icons), so make sure you have them installed.

<br />
Now choose any component you find useful, copy it to your project, and adjust it
so it fulfills your needs.
<br />
Keep in mind that these are YOUR components. It's on you to make them more reusable
and accessible. I created this to help you get started with neobrutalism.{' '}
