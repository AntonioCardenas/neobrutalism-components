## React Installation

These React components use <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwind</a> for styling and <a target="_blank" href="https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/">react-icons</a> for icons (feel free to use any other icons), so make sure you have them installed.

<br />
Now choose any component you find useful, copy it to your project, and adjust it
so it fulfills your needs.

<br />

### Accessibility

Keep in mind that these are YOUR components. It's on you to make them more reusable
and accessible. I created this to help you get started with neobrutalism.{' '}

<br />

If accessibility is one of your main concerns, I suggest you rather to use <a href='/shadcn/installation'>shadcn</a> components even tho these react components are somewhat accessible.

<br />

### Styling

Don't forget to copy the <a href='/docs/styling'>desired styling</a> to your tailwind config.

<Pagination
  next={{
    name: 'Accordion',
    path: '/react/components/Accordion',
