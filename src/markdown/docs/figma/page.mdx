## Shadcn Figma

Every shadcn component recreated in Figma. With customizable props, typography and icons.
I didn't add components for React because, if you plan to use React instead of Shadcn you probably don't even need a figma file.

You can find figma file  <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1445024004618320019" target="_blank">here</a>
